# Page Rank and Random Surfing model comparison 

## Goal
Both the intuitive Random Surf and the rigorous PageRank algorithm aim to determine the most relevant nodes within a graph.
However, the efficiency of each method in reaching this conclusion varies.
This program evaluates the time required for both algorithms.

## What I learnt
- I Discovered different methods of reading huge files efficiently with python.
- Implementing the Page Rank algorithm from scratch deepened my concept of it.
- The project shed light on the importance of mathematical optimization.

## How to use
To run the program: `python3 PageRank.py <filepath>`
To format a file for the script to interpret: `format <filepath>`
